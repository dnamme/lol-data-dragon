# DataDragon

DataDragon started as an experimental tool for HTTPRequests; it aims to recreate the loading screen from the game League of Legends using the [data](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#data-dragon) that Riot gives to its developers.

This tool lets you customize your own "loading screen," and it uses all images from the Data Dragon site, hence, the latest version is always used.
